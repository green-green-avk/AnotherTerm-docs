## Preface

Technically any Linux distribution can be used:
[debootstrap](https://wiki.debian.org/Debootstrap){:target="_blank"} utility to prepare a Debian rootfs for example;
though I see no reason to ignore already prebuilt rootfses (see below).

**Note:** Yes, **Termux** has its own *"minimal base distribution"* but I see no reason to mess with it
as long as **linuxcontainers.org** already provides us with a very good prebuilt rootfses
that could be installed just by copy-paste of a short quick install snippet (see next section):
* **Alpine** if you need it small: â‰ˆ15MB with `openssh-client` added (as of version 3.9);
* **Debian** or **CentOS** if you need it comfortable with a big software repository.

**One more note:** Please, don't hesitate to open new [issues](https://github.com/green-green-avk/AnotherTerm/issues){:target="_blank"}
(there is no template just write as you wish) if something doesn't work as expected.
Things are changing and new 3rd-party distributions could trigger some old god-forsaken bugs (mostly in **PRoot**).

PRoot version used: <https://github.com/green-green-avk/proot>{:target="_blank"}{:.long-url}

Install script source: <https://github.com/green-green-avk/AnotherTerm-scripts/blob/master/install-linuxcontainers.sh>{:target="_blank"}{:.long-url}

Install script usage:
```
sh ./install-linuxcontainers.sh [-a] [-d] <distro> <release> [<target_subdir_name>]

  -a -- non-interactive mode
  -d -- do not use minitar and PRoot from a plugin if present

Environment variables:
  REG_USER - user account name;
  FAV_SHELL - preferable shell;
  PROOT - proot location;
  PROOT_USERLAND - proot userland flavor location;
  ESSENTIALS_PKG - Application ID of a minitar and PRoot plugin to check.

Run without arguments to see defaults.
```

Directory tree:
```
$DATA_DIR/root - auxiliary tools installiation dir
         |proots/<install-dir-1>
                |...
                |<install-dir-n>/root/ - rootfs
                                     |etc/proot/run - the run script
                                               |run.cfg - the run script configuration
                                |tmp - PRoot tmp dir
                                |run - symlink to the run script
```

If you want to access the application's private directory (where all your PRoot rootfses with their metadata are located) from your PRooted environment, see `/etc/proot/run.cfg`.

PRoot run script source: <https://github.com/green-green-avk/AnotherTerm-scripts/blob/master/assets/run-tpl>{:target="_blank"}{:.long-url}

Uninstall:
```sh
rm -rf "$DATA_DIR/proots/<target_subdir_name>"
```

### Steps

1. If you have Android&nbsp;10 or higher, look for additional steps and explanation [here](local-shell-w-x.html#main_content){:target="_blank"}.
2. Create a "Local Terminal" favorite with the "Favorite management" permission enabled and run it. A terminal screen will appear.
3. Select a distribution and version in the form below and copy-paste the code snippet to the termial and run.
