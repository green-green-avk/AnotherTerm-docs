## Preface

Technically any Linux distribution can be used:
[debootstrap](https://wiki.debian.org/Debootstrap){:target="_blank"} utility to prepare a Debian rootfs for example;
though I see no reason to ignore already prebuilt rootfses (see below).

**Note:** Yes, **Termux** has its own *"minimal base distribution"* but I see no reason to mess with it
as long as **linuxcontainers.org** already provides us with a very good prebuilt rootfses
that could be installed just by copy-paste of a short quick install snippet (see next section):
* **Alpine** if you need it small: â‰ˆ15MB with `openssh-client` added (as of version 3.9);
* **Debian** or **CentOS** if you need it comfortable with a big software repository.

**One more note:** Please, don't hesitate to open new [issues](https://github.com/green-green-avk/AnotherTerm/issues){:target="_blank"}
(there is no template just write as you wish) if something doesn't work as expected.
Things are changing and new 3rd-party distributions could trigger some old god-forsaken bugs (mostly in **PRoot**).

Install script source: <https://github.com/green-green-avk/AnotherTerm-scripts/blob/master/install-linuxcontainers.sh>{:target="_blank"}

Install script usage:
```
sh ./install-linuxcontainers.sh [-a] [-d] <distro> <release> [<target_subdir_name>]

  -a -- non-interactive mode
  -d -- do not use minitar and PRoot from a plugin if present

Environment variables:
  REG_USER - user account name;
  FAV_SHELL - preferable shell;
  PROOT - proot location;
  PROOT_USERLAND - proot userland flavor location;
  ESSENTIALS_PKG - Application ID of a minitar and PRoot plugin to check.

Run without arguments to see defaults.
```

If you want to access the application's private directory (where all your PRoot rootfses with their metadata are located) from your PRooted environment, see `/etc/proot/run.cfg`.
